#### Hi there 👋. Thanks for stopping by.

I suppose you came here to find out who I am and what I do.

My wife says I am a tree hugging nerd (in Dutch: _geitenwollensokken nerd_). I think that is pretty accurate.

I spend most of my working days doing something in the area of data science, architecture and digital engineering. I enjoy teaching professionals at [EAISI Academy](https://www.tue.nl/en/education/professional-education/current-programs/eaisi-academy). I try to keep track of interesting teaching materials by collating an [anthology of data science](https://anthology-of-data.science).

I mostly work in the healthcare domain, trying to push the needle towards better [data interoperability with open source development as a lever](https://www.jmir.org/2025/1/e66616/).
