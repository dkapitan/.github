#### Hi there 👋. Thanks for stopping by.

I suppose you came here to find out who I am and what I do.

My wife says I am a tree-hugging hacker (in Dutch: _geitenwollensokken nerd_), which I think is pretty accurate.

I spend most of my working days on something related to data science, data architecture and platform engineering. I teach at [EAISI Academy Professional Education](https://www.tue.nl/en/education/professional-education/current-programs/eaisi-academy). I try to keep track of interesting teaching materials by collating an [anthology of data science](https://anthology-of-data.science).

I mostly work in the healthcare domain, trying to push the needle towards better [data interoperability with open source development as a lever](https://www.jmir.org/2025/1/e66616/). I am particularly interested in implementing decentralized data processing networks and have contributed to standardizing the concept of [data stations](https://health-ri.github.io/data-station-specification/) (in Dutch) within the context of the European Health Data Space. As the lead architect at [PLUGIN](https://plugin-healthcare.github.io/handbook) (also in Dutch) I am involved in deploying a nationwide federated learning network in the Netherlands.

I am a big open source advocate, particularly of the PyData ecosystem. With a gang of like-minded open source enthousiast, we are developing a 'data-platform-in-a-single-repo' that combines the best components from the [composable data stack](https://voltrondata.com/codex) into a sovereign data stack. As of January 2026 we are testing the platform on Scaleway. The project is named [wisent](https://github.com/wisent-one), after the European bison which is currently being [re-introduced in the Netherlands](https://www.wisenten.nl/en/netherlands). I like to think that we should be able to regain our independence and strategic autonomy in data here in the low countries, given our long-standing heritage with heroes like [Guido van Rossum](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum), [Edsger Dijkstra](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_Dijkstra) and more recently [Ritchie Vink](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ritchievink/), [Hannes Muhleisen](https://hannes.muehleisen.org/) and [Maarten Grootendorst](https://www.maartengrootendorst.com/), to name a few. Drop me a note if you are interested to collaborate.
